# News-sentiment-analyzer

An intro project for python webscraping. 

Initially, I intend to scrape headlines of news and use a pre-trained NLP model to analyze the sentiment of the news. Later I hope to build a more sophisticated project with my own NLP model and perhaps analyse statistics on company earnings reports.
