# News-sentiment-analyzer

An intro project for python webscraping. 

Initially, I intend to scrape headlines of news and use a pre-trained NLP model to analyze the sentiment of the news. Later I hope to build a more sophisticated project with my own NLP model and perhaps analyse statistics on company earnings reports. 

Libraries used:
- nltk
- beautifulsoup
- requests

# To-do 

- ~Scrape headlines of yahoo news~
- ~Add sentiment analysis of headlines using a pre-trained model~
- Refine sentiment analysis by adding financial lexicon
- Add functionality to scrape all yahoo finance articles on a particular stock and then visualise their sentiment compound_score over time.
- Create a website and host the project on AWS.
